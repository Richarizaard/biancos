We dramatically improve lives, by letting healthcare professionals turn extra time and ambition into career growth and financial opportunity. We achieve this with our app-based marketplace that connects healthcare facilities and healthcare professionals, allowing healthcare professionals to book on-demand shifts and healthcare facilities to access on-demand talent. Our mission is to enable healthcare professionals to work when and where they want, and to enable healthcare facilities to meet their talent needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Clipboard Health:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClipboard Health is a post-Series C, extremely fast-growing tech startup with classic two-sided network effects, revolutionizing the market for healthcare talent. We are a diverse and inclusive company with a global, remote team. We have been named one of \u003ca class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/\"\u003eYC’s Top Companies\u003c/a\u003e for two years running, and have grown 25x across all key metrics in the last 18 months. There has never been a more exciting time to join our growing team and help us serve even more healthcare professionals and healthcare facilities, who can then better serve patients. To learn more about the culture at Clipboard Health, take a look at our culture hub \u003ca class=\"c-link\" href=\"http://culture.clipboardhealth.com/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the Leadership Program!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eClipboard Health's Finance Leadership program is designed to help people with a deep background in finance take the next steps towards leadership fast, without waiting to pass arbitrary longevity milestones. We get you involved in leadership quickly by giving you the context, skills, and opportunities you need to transition from an individual contributor to an active, effective leader of people who makes big impacts on a daily basis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe like to keep our process simple, fast, and transparent in hopes that you have the best possible experience interviewing with us. As you look through the interview process below, you may be wondering why we start off with a case study right away and not a phone screen. The reasoning behind that is that we realized that the most dispositive part of our interview process is actually the case study itself. Given that the case study is the most critical part of our process, we want to lead with that and not waste your time. After the first case study, we're excited to hop on a video chat with you to get to know you. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven our asynchronous culture, we tried to answer most questions that would be covered by a recruiter phone call upfront by providing writing. This role sits within our Product Team, and I’d read the following docs from our team prior to applying: the \u003ca href=\"https://creatingvalue.substack.com/p/high-quality-and-fast\"\u003eProduct Team Standards\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://creatingvalue.substack.com/p/product-team-recruiting\"\u003eProduct Team Recruiting\u003c/a\u003e, and\u003ca href=\"https://creatingvalue.substack.com/p/the-product-team\"\u003eProduct Team Structure\u003c/a\u003e.

In the evenings and nights I help to keep our business safe whilst also finding ways to support the team around me - especially those new to the role - and during the day I'm free to take care of chores, spend time with friends  family, and also study! Talking of studying - the £1000 learning budget that Monzo grants each employee has allowed me to sign-up for an advanced course to hone my Investigator skills. Several of my peers are also doing this and it has been a great way to develop our understanding of the industry whilst also building a network of colleagues  friends. Initially, I found the pace of work challenging to maintain as Monzo operates a little differently to my previous employer and I worried that working later hours would mean reduced support - but the Out of Hours team were there to help me each step of the way, building my confidence, providing me with constructive feedback, and offering second opinions on trickier tasks.
