Hi there!

This pizza management app was written in Typescript <img src="https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/8584-typescript.png" width="24px" height="24px" alt="TypeScript">, React <img src="https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/3203-reactjs.png" width="24px" height="24px" alt="reactjs">, GraphQL, and Ruby on Rails <img src="https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/5648_ruby_logo.png" width="64px" height="64px" alt="ruby_logo">.

Backend testing suite uses RSpec, FactoryBot, and Faker



Open up two consoles and run the following two commands - 
`bin/vite dev` and `rails s`

Navigate to `localhost:3000` and play around with the app!

If you want to run rspec tests that test the rails models and mutations you can -

  - Run a specific test via `rspec spec/.../*_spec.rb
  - Run the whole suite of tests via `yarn rspec-all`
